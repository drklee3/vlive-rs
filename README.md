# vlive-rs

Unofficial Rust wrapper for VLive API.

**Disclaimer:** Because VLive's API is kind of a mess, this codebase is also a
mess since I really don't really want to deal with the API more than necessary.

**Another disclaimer:** This API wrapper is **not** stable and will have
breaking changes fairly frequently, partially due to the fact that API responses
are inconsistent and may break deserializing
